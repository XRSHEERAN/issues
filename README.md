This *repo* contains solutions for leetcode questions. I wrote most of those solutions in JAVA and part of them in Python. This project is just for parctising and I have gains familarity with those data structures in all languages especially JAVA.

## Rules of Classification
The repo is casually classified by the company at first. Then I decided to focus on the top interview questions, which is more *general* and *representative*.
